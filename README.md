# Flower: A flow-based programming environment for kaleidoscope patterns

![](./img/flower.jpg)

Flow-based programming is one of the programming paradigm.  It represents all of the process and data as the graph composed of nodes and edges.

There are many software using Flow-based programming environment. For example, 3D modeling software like blender or maya adopt flow-based programming in order to make textures of objects.
In addition, there are audio visual programming environment such as PureData or TouchDesigner. 
However, there is no mathematical software using flow-based programming environment.

So, I'm developing geometrical software called Flower to generate kaleidoscope patterns based on flow-based programming. The link of the Flower is as follows.
